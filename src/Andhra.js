          <h2>"The Heritage Haven of Andhra"</h2> <h3>Anantapur Tourism</h3>{' '}
          Anantapuram is the headquarters of Anantapur District in the Indian
          state of Andhra Pradesh. Anantapuram is not a cosmopolitan city.
          Neither is it a village. It is one of those towns in transition, that
          is at the confluence of the past and the future. Anantapuram
          reverberates with flashes of India's glorious history and the true
          ethnic traditions and values of India. Interestingly, Anantapur
          receives the second-lowest rainfall in India. Anantapur has seen the
          rule of many empires, but the Vijayanagar Empire has had a greater
          impact on it. It is said that the place has derived its name from
          'Anaatasagaram', a big tank, which translates into 'Endless Ocean'.
          Chikkavodeya, the minister of the Vijayanagar King, Bukka-I
          constructed the town of Anaatasagaram and Bukkarayasamudram.
